The many projects contained in this folder are the fruits of our GUI-creation team.
Each project typically contains one or two GUIs that serve a well defined purpose.
The culmination of all of these smaller projects is a project of its own: 'sprint 1 def'.
Instead of opening all the seperate projects to check out what they look like; it is best
to simply check 'sprint 1 def'. The other projects are merely there to show off all of our
work; and not just the end result. They are likely to be removed some time in the future.

In order to run any of the projects:
Open the solution (.sln) file in Microsoft Visual Studio.
Click build and select 'Build Solution'.
Once it has finished building, select Debug > Start Without Debugging

In order to register and login, make sure the API is running. 
You may have to edit the connectionstring in the configuration file.
